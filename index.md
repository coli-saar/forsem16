# Current Topics in Computational Linguistics
---------------------------------

AM 11/AM 12: Current Topics in Computational Linguistics  
Summer Semester 2016  
[Prof. Dr. Alexander Koller](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~koller/)  
Di 12-14; Golm, Haus 14, Raum 0.09

**Start: Tuesday, April 21**

As in previous semesters, I am opening the Computational Linguistics
lab meeting to interested MSc students. We will read and discuss
current papers in CL. Currently our focus is on computational
semantics and statistical methods, particularly neural networks.

The seminar will be a great way to be exposed to the current
literature. However, it will also be very challenging, in that we will
assume that everyone who comes to the lab meetings has read the
assigned literature, so you may need to read up on some background by
yourself.

To get credit for the class, you will need to participate actively in
the group discussions, and lead the discussion on at least one
paper. In the end, you will write a seminar paper summarizing and
working out some topics that we covered in the discussions.

If you would like to participate, please get in touch with me by
email.
