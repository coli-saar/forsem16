# Research Seminar in Computational Linguistics
---------------------------------

Winter Semester 2016/17  
[Prof. Dr. Alexander Koller](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~koller/)  
Tue 12-14; Meeting Room 2.11

**Start: Tuesday, November 8**

---

This is the weekly meeting of Prof. Koller's research group. It is
open to interested MSc students. The purpose of this meeting is to
read and discuss current papers in computational
linguistics. Recently, our focus has been on computational semantics
and statistical methods, particularly neural networks, but this may
change with the participants' interests.

In this semester, we will try out the
[format](http://wiki.clsp.jhu.edu/view/NLP_Reading_Group/Presenting)
of Jason Eisner's reading group at JHU. Each participant will be
responsible for three successive meetings, in that they will pick the
papers that will be discussed at these meetings. Everybody will read
these papers and provide questions in a Google document, and then the
managing participant will lead the discussions.

The seminar will be a great way to be exposed to the current
literature. However, it will also be very challenging, in that we will
assume that everyone who comes to the lab meetings has read the
assigned literature, so you may need to read up on some background by
yourself. To get credit for the class, you will need to lead the group
on three successive meetings (see above) and otherwise participate
actively. In the end, you will write a seminar paper summarizing and
working out some topics that we covered in the discussions.

If you would like to participate, please get in touch with me by
email before the first meeting.
